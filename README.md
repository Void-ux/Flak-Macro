This is a script compiled in AutoHotKey to quickly equip flak from a folder.

Customisation:
  - z:: | Can be changed to anything, this is what executes the code
  - sleep, x | Can be changed to any value (in ms). This is the delay for when you open your inventory as it takes some time. Slower machines often need more time.
  - send, v | Can be changed to any key. This is what open/closes your inventory
